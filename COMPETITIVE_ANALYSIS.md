## Next Steps

Should we start with **Phase 1** and implement the advanced static analysis engine? This would immediately differentiate VulnaraX from basic dependency scanners and position it as a serious competitor to commercial SAST tools.

Or would you prefer to focus on a different area first? The ML/AI capabilities could be a strong differentiator if we implement them early.
